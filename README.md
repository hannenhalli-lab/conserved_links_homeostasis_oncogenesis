Conserved links between oncogenesis and key homeostatic processes - stress response, wound healing, and regeneration


Similarities between oncogenesis and several homeostatic processes (HP) -- wound healing, regeneration, and cellular stress response, have long been recognized, however, the molecular underpinning of these similarities is not entirely known. Moreover, while several molecular aspects of HP are evolutionarily conserved, different species show large variation in the genes involved in these HP as well as predisposition to cancer. Leveraging XX published experimental  datasets of genes implicated in HP across multiple species, here we comprehensively investigate links between HP and human cancers. We find that across cancer types HP genes are significantly perturbed, both mutationally and transcriptionally, and associated with patient survival. In the human protein interaction network, HP genes cluster by the process type as well as as with the known cancer driver genes. We show that network proximity to the HP genes can distinguish cancer drivers with an auROC of 0.76 and help reveal several additional potential cancer drivers consistent with greater mutation rates and association with survival. Overall, we present a first comparative analysis of cancer drivers with conserved homeostatic processes, suggesting a complementary alternative to prioritize cancer drivers.
